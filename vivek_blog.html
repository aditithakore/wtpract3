            One might use the word 'anxious' quite often. However, there's a massive difference between feeling nervous
            or anxious and experiencing the mental health challenges of Generalised Anxiety Disorder. Anxiety happens
            to appear different for different people. There is a solid amalgamation of manifestation of physical
            symptoms such as shaking, shivering, restlessness, sleeplessness, indigestion, acidity, nausea, headache,
            chest burns, etc and mental suffering that occurs due to excessive fear, overthinking, loss of control and
            emotional breakdowns. Even though the symptoms remain subjective, the feelings of the survivors of anxiety
            could be put through some generalization. These are certain things that people sudden from anxiety would
            want people around them to know and moreover, understand.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: left; margin-left:2%;font: size 30px;">
            <b>1. We cannot just 'Calm Down'</b><br> It is understandable that one might instinctively want to provide
            consolation to the people dealing with anxiety when they hit their peak by helping them to calm down.
            Perhaps, the fact that one has anxiety is accompanied by the reality that they cannot calm down even if
            they would want to. Thus, an external attempt to calm them down would possibly have contrary outcomes
            making the situation worse than it was. Instead, what one could do is make them feel that their feelings
            are valid and acknowledged by you and thereby express and convey support to them.<br>

            <b>2. Anxiety is more than just being scared.</b><br> The fear that anxiety brings is not just the normal
            nervousness but an intensified panic that could sometimes even commence without the presence of a trigger.
            The person could possibly know that he has no reason to be anxious and the fact that he can still not help
            himself feel okay intensifies his anxiety levels. In such instances, calling your anxious friends out or
            disregarding their fears and insecurities would be extremely destructive to their well-being. It could make
            them feel uncomfortable in expressing themselves and their true feelings as a result of feeling
            misunderstood and judged.<br>

            <b>3. Anxiety is accompanied by a lot of guilt.</b><br> The presence of anxiety, it's unavoidable mental
            and physical symptoms can get too overwhelming for one to take. It's hard to deal with a disorder like
            anxiety but what is even harder is to love and provide comfort to someone who's going through that turmoil
            of discomfort in their lives. Anxiety fighters are aware of this. They certainly know that they tend to
            overburden any relationship due to their thought processes, need for reassurances and unstoppable
            overthinking. This results in them experiencing a solid guilt trip as they don't intend to add baggage into
            their loved one's lives but somehow end up doing so. A genuine understanding that your anxious friend or
            child isn't throwing tantrums but is actually dealing with a riot of thoughts and your help is making
            things better for both of you would ease things up.<br>

            <b>4. Sometimes, Anxiety gets triggered out of nowhere.</b><br> Yes, anxiety attacks and anxiety are mostly
            triggered. These triggers could be anything very minor to something quite solemn. One's anxiety would grow
            up slowly hearing or watching something sensitive to his emotions or due to a serious argument he's indulged
            into. This is commonly known by everyone. What comes as a shock to people is when one doesn't have a trigger
            or a solid reason for their anxiety. It just happens. They are just dealing with restlessness, insomnia,
            nausea and thoughts of distraught. It is better if one doesn't force them to find reasons for them feeling
            a certain way as the unawareness could make them experience an increased level of anxiety.<br>

            <b>5. A little understanding and reassurance could work wonders.</b><br> All you need to help your loved
            ones is build massive patience with them. Being patient with them, could enhance the efficacy of your
            understanding of their suffering. Once people dealing with this disorder feel understood, they begin to feel
            safe. A place or a person that one feels safe to communicate with is the best aid one can get. When one
            suffers from anxiety and anxious thoughts, reassurance becomes a need. Perhaps it would be lovely if we as
            friends and relatives don't make them feel needy and unsure all the time and give them reassurance even
            before they feel the need of having it.<br>

            <b>6. Unsolicited Opinions and advice really don't do any good.</b><br> The worst thing one could really do
            is give advice to a person dealing with anxiety or in the middle of an emotional breakdown as a result of
            anxiety. One's opinions and unsolicited guidance of someone else's personal issues and suffering makes them
            want to lash out with rage or suppress their emotions. So the best way to tackle your closed one's encounter
            with anxiety is to hear them vent or rant as much as they would wish. Words like 'chill', 'calm down' or ' I
            understand' should be strictly not used as they just add to one's suffering.<br>

            <b>7. We don't need your sympathy, we need your sincerity.</b><br> No one likes pity. People dealing with
            anxiety too hate being sympathised. They do not like an obvious biased treatment towards them because of your
            awareness of their disorder. They don't like your tone when you make it sound like how miserable their life
            is and how sorry you feel for them. On the contrary, what one does like is honesty and sincerity. A genuine
            concern by the loved ones. Acts of affection that are real and from affection more than just giving them
            sympathetic attention. You could also appreciate them for their courage to get up and fight something so
            disturbing on a day to day basis. An 'I'm proud of you' also makes a huge difference for good in one's life.<br>

            <b>8. We cannot let go easily.</b><br> We often find people dealing with anxiety stick to one issue or one
            topic for a long time. Sometimes they're vocal about it. Other times, they would deal with it alone in their
            head. It is compulsive due to the nature of the disorder and one cannot help himself to a large degree in
            spite of trying hard. An understanding of their inability to let things go easily is very crucial on the part
            of people around them. Nonchalant attitude towards them and shallow comments such as 'You're just
            overthinking', 'You're dragging it unnecessarily', 'Just let it go' are real triggers for them and might
            lead them to lose their control over another episode of anxiety.<br>

            <b>9. We can't help ourselves from getting overwhelmed and experiencing incessant burnouts</b><br> Any Mental
            Health disorder can be extremely taxing because it's not just your brain eating you up but it also
            compromises immense physical pain. Thus your body and brain tend to give up at some point as a result of
            continuous mental and physical fatigue. A rush of unstoppable thoughts accompanied by restlessness and chest
            burns can get severely overwhelming. If this continues for multiple days, one cannot resist facing burnouts
            and breakdowns. Only kindness and expression of real care and concern is a way to make your loved one's feel
            lighter as they fight their tough battles.<br>

            <b>10. We do try our best.</b><br> The fact that someone is living with anxiety itself proves how hard they
            are trying. Mental health is glorified in an attempt to Destigmatize. The reality is Anxiety, just like any
            other mental health disorder is gruesome and dark. It puts one through a series of bad days, some with
            reasons and some without reasons. It not only plays with one's mind but the hormonal imbalance and neural
            changes also cause severe destruction to the body. The emotional turmoil is so hard to deal with that one's
            hope to move out of this horrid disorder, begins to flutter. And yet one keeps going, day after day, week
            after week and month after month proving how they give in all of their energy fighting and surviving through
            the toughest of fights, that too, with his own self.
